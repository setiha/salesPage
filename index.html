                We are Víctor and Laura and we have designed and created this `dream´ together.
                We know how you feel when you think that you will never be able to be fluent in a new language because
                it
                happened to us too.
            </div>
            <div class="p-3">
                By the time we met, we had both lived in many different countries such us: England, USA, Spain,
                India,
                Greece, Mexico, Portugal, Qatar.... And we have experienced many times the feeling you get when you
                just
                cannot express your basic needs or the sense of loneliness you may know, for not being able to make
                new
                friends because the foreign or native people you meet don't want to waste their time communicating
                with
                you
                barely speaking their language.
            </div>
            <div class="p-3">
                At the moment, we both can speak four languages and we are more than happy to have fulfilled
                boundaries
                that
                once we thought were impossible.
                We embraced the learning process knowing that it would take time, effort and strength and feeling a
                great
                sympathy for our students.
                We are now sharing our experience, knowledge and personal tips with many
                travellers from all over the world who come to Gozo to learn, discover and have a good time with us.

                At Ta Óniera we have thought and worked to create an amazing experience which combines learning
                English
                while enjoying your holidays in the Mediterranean island of Gozo, Malta, where English is the second
                official language. You will be exposed to the English language and have fun being engaged in the
                great
                number of activities that Gozo offers.
                Dedicated to English students like you, who don't feel like spending their vacations in the typical
                student´s destinations, we have designed a personalised English method making sure that you will
                learn
